# Youtube Playlist Length Calculator
Calculates the length of a Youtube Playlist. Bunch of links I tried were down and didn't work properly, so wrote my own.

# To Run:
* git clone the repo.
* From your terminal, run python PlaylistLength.py
* Go to localhost:5000 in your browser and insert the link in the input box.
* Click Submit

# TODO
* Update README, add requirements.py
* Add a UI
* Add Video Count
